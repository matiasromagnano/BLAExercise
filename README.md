## User Story: Managing my Sneaker Collection with the SneakerCollection API

As a sneaker collector, I want a Web API that allows me to **manage my personal collection of sneakers securely**. This includes:

- **Registering for an account** so I can have my own space to store my collection.
- **Logging in** to access my collection securely.
- **Adding new sneakers** to keep my collection up to date.
- **Viewing my collection** with options to **sort** and **paginate**, making it easy to browse through my sneakers.
- **Updating sneaker details** when I need to correct or change information.
- **Deleting sneakers** I no longer want in my collection.
- **Viewing specific sneaker details** to check information about a particular pair.

The API should ensure that my data is **private and only accessible to me after authentication**, keeping my collection safe from others.
